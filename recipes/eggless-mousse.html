    <p><strong>Perfect make-ahead dessert</strong>for your guests or special ones. You can make it a day before and keep it in the fridge. Each bite melts away in your mouth and the richness can’t be matched.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heavy Whipping Cream: Make sure to use the one which has more than 35% of fat content. This fat content helps to whip up the cream nicely to a stiff peak. Many readers are from India and they have tried with Amul fresh cream and it worked perfectly fine. </li>
        <li>Brewed coffee: It helps to bring out the chocolate flavor even more intense. Just a little amount is required, so save some from your morning coffee. Or use the instant coffee mixed up in hot water.</li>
        <li>Semi-sweet Chocolate: You can use a block of semi-sweet chocolate and chop it up into small pieces. Or just use the chocolate chips as I have done here. The taste/flavor of eggless chocolate mousse purely depends on the brand of chocolate that you use. </li>
        <li>Vanilla essence</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>ake chocolate chips, butter and brewed coffee in a microwave-safe bowl.

        </li>
        <li>Heat it for 30 seconds. Start mixing until everything is combined, melted and becomes smooth and shiny. Let it cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Meantime whip the cream. Take the chilled heavy whipping cream and vanilla in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Start whipping it using a hand mixer (or stand mixer with a whisk attachment). Whip it until you get stiff peaks. Do not over beat it otherwise cream will curdle and it will turn into butter. Save around ¼ cup of whipped cream in a small bowl for garnishing later on. Keep in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Now check the melted chocolate is cooled to room temp. Add ⅓ part of the whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in using a spatula. Do not mix it vigorously do it slowly and gently.</li>
        <li>Now add another third portion of it and fold it.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining ⅓ part and fold it in. You’ll notice how light and airy it is.</li>
        <li>Divide the mousse into individual serving bowls/glasses. Cover it and keep it in the refrigerator to set for about 2 hours or more. Lastly, garnish with saved whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa powder.</li>
    </ol>
