    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Greek Yogurt: It is nothing but the strained yogurt. All the whey liquid is strained out from the yogurt to get dense, thick greek yogurt. Itâ€™s the same as Indian makes hung curd to make shrikhand.</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar: I have used store-bought powdered sugar (aka confectioner sugar or icing sugar). You can use regular granulated sugar. If so please grind into a powder form so it will be easy to mix with yogurt without messing the consistency.</li>
        <li>Cardamom powder: The seeds of green cardamom pods are powdered or crushed here and used in the recipe.</li>
        <li>Nuts: I have used almonds, cashews and pistachios. This is the most common trio of nuts in Indian sweets. You can use just one or a combination of two as per your liking</li>
        <li>Saffron: It is dissolved in the warm milk to extract its maximum flavor and color. I would not recommend skipping it. It gives a really good flavor.        </li>
        <li>milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush the saffron using your fingers and add to the warm milk. Stir and keep it aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl add greek yogurt, powdered sugar, saffron milk. Now fold and mix. Do not stir or whisk vigorously otherwise shrikhand will get a runny consistency.</li>
        <li>Now add cardamom powder and nuts.</li>
        <li>Again fold them in. Cover it and chill in the refrigerator till serving. Shrikhand tastes best when served chilled.</li>
