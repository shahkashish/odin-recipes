    <p><strong>This no bake strawberry cheesecake is total dessert bliss! </strong>The texture is amazingly melt-in-your-mouth light and fluffy. It has a buttery graham cracker crust with a rich, creamy filling that is flavored with fresh strawberry reduction sauce.    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Strawberries - I have used fresh strawberries and made a smooth puree into the blender. Instead, you can use frozen ones to make this sauce. </li>
        <li>Corn starch - It helps to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Graham cracker crumbs - This gives a delicious, crunchy cheesecake crust. Instead, you can use digestive biscuits.</li>
        <li>Melted butter - it is combined with graham cracker crumbs and helps the base to set and gives a rich, buttery flavor.</li>
        <li>Cream cheese - This is the key ingredient in this no bake strawberry cheesecake just like all other cheesecake recipes. It gives a creamy and tangy flavor. Make sure to use room temperature cream cheese to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk - It adds sweetness, creaminess to the cheesecake filling.</li>
        <li>Lemon juice - Please use the freshly squeezed lemon juice. It adds a fresh tanginess and brightens everything up. It also enhances the overall flavors.</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Take graham cracker crumbs in a bowl and add melted, cooled butter.</li>
        <li> Mix everything well.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture into the 8 or 9 inch springform pan and spread it out using a spoon or spatula so crumbs are evenly distributed. </li>
        <li>Press and smooth out the surface using flat-bottomed glass or bowl. Press hard so the crust holds together well. Cover it with plastic wrap and keep it in the refrigerator meantime you make the cheesecake filling.</li>
        <li>Take strawberry puree, sugar, corn starch and lemon juice in a saucepan. </li>
        <li>Mix everything well and make a lump-free mixture. Turn the heat on and bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Then keep stirring constantly and keep cooking on medium-low heat.        </li>
        <li> Cook until thickened and reduce by half. Remove it to a bowl and let it cool down to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Take room temperature-softened cream cheese, condensed milk and lemon juice in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Using a hand mixer (or whisk attachment in a stand mixer) beat it until everything is combined and smooth.</li>
        <li> Add Â¼ cup of strawberry sauce (cooled to room temperature).</li>
        <li>Beat it again until everything is combined and smooth. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl using a spatula and make sure everything is well combined.</li>
        <li> Remove the springform pan from the fridge. Transfer the filling mixture into the pan. Spread evenly and smooth out using a spatula.</li>
        <li>Take remaining strawberry sauce into the piping bag and pipe in the spiral shape on top of the filling.</li>
        <li>Now take a toothpick and run back and forth (from center to outwards) to create swirls.</li>
        <li> Cover the pan with plastic wrap. Keep the pan in another tray for easy transfer. Chill in the refrigerator overnight and let it set. Once set, slice and serve. </li>
    </ol>
