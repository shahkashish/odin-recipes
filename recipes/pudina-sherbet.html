    <p>I call this<strong> mint sherbet or pudina sherbet </strong> just because this is not the plain mint juice but it has few Indian spices as well.During the summer season, you need to stay hydrated well. Along with the hydration, you need something that will cool your body heat. For this purpose, this juice is the perfect beverage for that.

        <li>Add remaining water and swirl again 2-3 times or till just all get incorporated.</li>
        <li>If you want you can strain the juice using strainer. I skipped this step because I like this way then why do extra step.</li>
        <li>If your water is not chilled then chill it in the refrigerator or serve with ice cubes.</li>
